About The Project
This is a modern, fast, and responsive React application built using Vite â€” a next-generation frontend build tool. The project demonstrates how to efficiently develop and deploy React apps with Vite and Netlify.

Vite enables lightning-fast development with instant hot module replacement.

React provides a powerful, component-based UI structure.

Netlify is used for continuous deployment and hosting with global CDN support.

This setup is ideal for building scalable web applications that need fast loading times and easy deployment workflows.
